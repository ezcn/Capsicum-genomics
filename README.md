### Genomic diversity of the *Capsicum* genus at 746k variable sites.
<img align="left" src="img/varianttype4.png"> 

We discovered 746k variable sites by sequencing 1.8% of the genome in a collection of 373 accessions belonging to 11 *Capsicum* species from 51 countries.
 
The majority of variants is single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), followed multi-nucleotide polymorphisms (MNP) and insertions/deletion (INDEL). A very small fraction of variants is complex combinations of SNP, MNP, and INDEL. QUAL>10 refers to Phred-scaled quality scores.

### Population structure of *Capsicum* reveals strong subdivisions with little or no admixiture among species.

**Population structure of the *Capsicum* species derived from 746k genome variants.**

a)Phylogenetic reconstruction of the relationship between the accessions. With a few exceptions, clusters corrispond to species.
b)Principal component analysis. The first two components separate the three main domesticated species. The third and the fourth components separate *C. pubescens* and *C. chacoense* between them and from the cluster of domesticated species.
c)Model based admixture analysis in the hypothesis of seven clusters. With the exceptions of few admixed or misplaced individuals, clusters to corrispond to species and within *C. annuum* is possible to observe two groups with distinct genetic features.

### Insight into *C. annuum* fruit variability from high resolution phenotyping.

Fruits broad variability has been driven by breeding programs and has been mainly studied by linkage analysis. 
We carried out phenotyping of the 220 accessions of *C. annuum* at thirty-eight phenotypic traits, in order to describe and understand the range of variation of *C. annum* fruits.

**Graphic rapresentation of the phenotypes measured.**

![Figure 4](img/pepperpheno.png)

**Bulky and large peppers are genetically different from small ones**

Subdivision within *C. annuum* accessions into two clusters is associated with significant differences in  four traits related to fruit size 

![Figure 5](img/pre-panel4.png)


Accessions from *C. annuum* were assigned to genetic clusters determined in the admixture analysis if membership to the cluster was > 90%.
Of the 38 traits, AREA, MAXIMUMWIDTH, WIDTHMIDHEIGHT, and PERIMETER are significantly different between the two genetic clusters.
Fruit size is significantly different between the two genetic clusters, with Cluster 1 having bulkier and larger fruits relative
to Cluster 2. This suggests that differences in fruit size in *C. annuum* might be caused by genetic differences. 


### Genetics of fruit in *C. annuum*.

**Results of the genome-wide association anlysis.**

a)We identified eight variants at four loci on three chromosomes, significant associated with seven traits. Circles represent association between one genetic variant and one trait. Colors distingish phenotype.
b)Cluster of phenotype determining whether fruits are pointed or squared.
c)Cluster of phenotypes determining if fruits are circular or elongated.
